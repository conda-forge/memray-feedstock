  summary: Memray is a memory profiler for Python
  description: |
    Memray is a memory profiler for Python. It can track memory allocations in
    Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter
    itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you
    analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool,
    it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling
    tasks.
